# Web Dev Final Outline

## Concept / Theme
For my final, I will be expanding and improving the design portfolio website I made for my midterm. The final product of my midterm set a proper framework for UX, as the user could easily navigate through different artworks, background information,  the contact page and resume page. Now that I have more experience with different HTML, CSS and JavaScript functions, I would like to enhance the UX and visual aesthetic of the site to better reflect my personal artistic expression. Much of my artwork is vibrant, expressive and colourful. I see a portfolio website as a less obvious form of artwork that the artist is presenting when people visit it, as it exhibits the artist's use of different design elements. Thus, I would like to include more user interaction with the site such as an animated loading page, an animated logo, and more affordability/feedback from every button and linked item.
